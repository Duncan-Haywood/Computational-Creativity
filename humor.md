# Humor 

## Weaknesses of the Article

- humor is discussed in a very narrow context
- the author only deals with verbal humor which, granted, is a very popular
  form of humor, it's not the only one so the article title is a bit misleading
  because it is not about humor in general, it's about verbal humor
- neither of the systems are intelligent i.e. they cannot be said to understand
  why the thing they created is amusing, there is also no intention behind
  those systems, they are literally programs that use a fixed template to
  generate e.g. puns, "punning riddles",
- the humour created by those systems is very crude and often not funny at all
  and is some cases it's not comprehensible
- because of that it's questionable if the systems mentioned in the article were creative at all
- the systems seem to rely on recombination of data that has been fed into them
  in advance. It's questionable if that counts as "creative".
- the research the author mentions (Mihalcea and Strapparava (2006)) was not
  very successful in creating an accurate classifier meaning it is difficult
  for a computational system to recognise humor, it performed well on some data
    (0.77 \& 0.96 accuracy) but not so well on other (0.54 accuracy)...Furthermore, the authors of the research (which is not mentioned) used Naive Bayes classifier which is probably not the best choice of an algorithm. Natural language is context sensitive meaning the things you say before (context) affect the meaning of information that follows. Naive Bayes classifier would assume that each word is a separate (isolated) entity and it doesn't affect the meaning of other words.
- as the author mentioned, there is no formal theory of humor
- we might have an intuitive idea what makes something funny e.g. when
  something is unexpected or out of place or very surprising, but we do not
  have a good formal definition which captures all forms of humor. We cannot create a metric to evaluate how funny something is. There is also the issue that humor is a very subjective thing. Some thing are not seen as funny by some people.
- It's not the case that we don't have theories of humour, after some Googling
  I was able to find:
  - O'Shannon model of humor
  - Benign violation theory
  - Misattribution theory
  - Ontic-Epistemic Theory of Humor
  - Computational-Neural Theory of Humor
  - Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor
  - General Theory of Verbal Humor
  - Incongruous juxtaposition theory
- another issue that should have been raised is that the task of creating
  humour is a very difficult one, even for humans. Not everyone would make
  a great comedian and I'm sure you all have heard people fail at humour.
- research into computational humor seems to be very lacking BUT the article is
  10 years old so it's possible that things have improved since the article was
  written
