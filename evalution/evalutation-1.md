# Evaluation 

- look at domain experts, see what is seen as "creative"
- break down creativity into distinct components and then try to emulate each
  of them
- the creative tripod (2008)
- FACE and IDEA models (they build on the creative tripod model)
- $creativity = novelty + value (+ x?)$
- jokes aren't useful
- some models such as the DIFI model (1988), emphasise the social and broader aspect of
  creativity, nothing is created in a vacuum and the context and culture
  dictates what is novel and useful
- the society decides what is acceptable, useful, novel (multiple influences)
- Wallas described stages of creativity (as done by humans) but it is
  questionable if computers should be forced to emulate the creativity process
  (maybe there is a more efficient way of doing that)
- the Boden framework (2004) -- transformational, exploratory, combinatory
- the black box model (neural networks) is a disadvantage since we cannot
  verify the choices made by the system (see the blackboard model in the poetry
  system)
- the output may not be enough to decide if a system is creative
- a system may not be creative if it is performing a very narrow task (e.g. it
  ONLY creates jokes, especially if the jokes aren't good at all)
- use Laplace Smoothing for the conditional probabilities!
- see <https://www.creativitypost.com/index.php?p=technology/evaluating_computational_creativity>
- create a Naive Bayes classifier to classify nouns if they are objects or
  people (decision tree may work as well)
