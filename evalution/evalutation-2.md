# Evaluation 

- look at domain experts, see what is seen as "creative"
- break down creativity into distinct components and then try to emulate each
  of them
- FACE and IDEA models
- $creativity = novelty + value (+ x?)$
- comparing with a human's work may not be fair
- computers may be better (i.e. have an edge) when working within time
  constraints so if you evaluate a game generation system like the one in the
  game jam paper, the system may compare much better than it would if the
  humans had more time to work on the game
- expertise may change the way you judge the value of an item
- vary one thing to ensure it's not too chaotic
- with natural-language based systems you have to be creative in the way
  language is used and in the domain of stories more specifically you need to
  be creative with regard to the story (development of character)

## Criteria

### General

- transformational vs exploratory creativity
- was it really novel or did it rely on recombination
- does the system realise the value of what it created (refer to Chinese Room Argument)

### Specific to Story-Telling System

- does it make sense?
- is it interesting?
- are there any contradictions?
- is the text properly formatted? (punctuation)
- are the words used in the correct context?
